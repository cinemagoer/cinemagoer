People who contributed a substantial amount of work and share the copyright
over some portions of the code:

Davide Alberani <da --> mimante.net>

  Main author and project leader.


\H. Turgut Uyar <uyar --> tekir.org>

  The whole "http" data access system (using a DOM and XPath-based
  approach) is based on his work. The imdbpykit interface was mostly written
