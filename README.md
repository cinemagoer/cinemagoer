# imdbpy3
This package is modified version of [imdbpy](https://github.com/alberanid/imdbpy).

Modifications
- Removed person, character and company classes
- Removed 'sql', 'mobile' and 'httpthin' access system
- Support for python3

I don't mean any disrespect to the original author by making these changes. Above changes were made because original package was too big for my requirement and I didn't want to port extra code to python3 which I never would be using.

Credit goes to the [alberanid](https://github.com/alberanid) for creating such an excellent python package for getting IMDB information via python.
