# This script downloads and applies any and all imdb diff files which
# have not already been applied to the lists in the ImdbListsPath folder
#
# NOTE: this is especially useful in Windows environment; you have
# to modify the paths in the 'Script configuration' section below,
# accordingly with your needs.
#
# The script will check the imdb list files (compressed or incompressed)
# in ImdbListsPath and assume that the imdb lists were most recently downloaded
# or updated based on the most recently modified list file in that folder.
#
# In order to run correctly, the configuration section below needs to be
# set to the location of the imdb list files and the commands required to
# unGzip, UnTar, patch and Gzip files.
#
# Optional configuration settings are to set the imdb diff files download and/or
# backup folders. If you do not want to keep or backup the downloaded imdb diff
# files then set keepDiffFiles to False and diffFilesBackupFolder to None.
#
# If RunAfterSuccessfulUpdate is set to a value other than None then the program
# specified will be run after the imdb list files have been successfully updated.
# This enables, for example, the script to automatically run imdbPy to rebuild
# the database once the imdb list files have been updated.
#
# If a specific downloaded imdb diff file cannot be applied correctly then this script
# will fail as gracefully as possible.
