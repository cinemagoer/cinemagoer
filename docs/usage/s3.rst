S3 datasets
===========

IMDb distributes some of its data as downloadable `datasets`_. IMDbPY can
import this data into a database and make it accessible through its API.
[#ptdf]_

For this, you will first need to install `SQLAlchemy`_ and the libraries
that are needed for the database server you want to use. Check out
the `SQLAlchemy dialects`_ documentation for more detail.

Then, follow these steps:

#. Download the files from the following address and put all of them
   in the same directory: https://datasets.imdbws.com/

#. Create a database. Use a collation like ``utf8_unicode_ci``.

#. Import the data using the :file:`s32imdbpy.py` script::

      s32imdbpy.py /path/to/the/tsv.gz/files/ URI

   *URI* is the identifier used to access the SQL database. For example::

      s32imdbpy.py ~/Download/imdb-s3-dataset-2018-02-07/ \
          postgres://user:password@localhost/imdb

Once the import is finished -which should take about an hour or less
on a modern system- you will have a SQL database with all the information
and you can use the normal IMDbPY API:

.. code-block:: python

   from imdb import IMDb

   ia = IMDb('s3', 'postgres://user:password@localhost/imdb')

   results = ia.search_movie('the matrix')
   for result in results:
       print(result.movieID, result)

   matrix = results[0]
   ia.update(matrix)
   print(matrix.keys())


.. note::

   Running the script again will drop the current tables and import
   the data again.

   Until the end of 2017, IMDb used to distribute a more comprehensive subset
   of its data in a different format. IMDbPY can also import that data
   but note that the data is not being updated anymore. For more information,
   see :ref:`ptdf`.
